   Summary: Performed ASCII normalization across many files (excluding prompt.zsh), added some new config entries (e.g., .editorconfig, .gitattributes), and logged diffs to ~/cleanuplog.txt.

Effect of reverts:
- Restored shell/p10k.zsh (undoing its deletion).
- Restored prior pre-commit hook content (removing the portability changes from a5b1d4d).
- Reverted the wide ASCII normalization and related config additions; removed git/attributes and reverted numerous edits across various dotfiles. Some file mode changes were also reverted (e.g., back to pre-normalization modes).

Notes:
- The reverts were applied newest to oldest to reduce conflict risk.
- No manual conflict resolution was required.
